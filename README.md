# Jobmatch-Tampermonkey
A Tampermonkey user script that enhances the UJM activity log

https://jobsearch.direct.gov.uk/Account/ActivityHistory.aspx

see my blog entry at http://hwhap.com/2016/07/25/fixing-ujm/

Features:

- javascript validation on the length of notes
- warning of idle session timeout if you edit a note
- onscreen display of idle time  
- improved styling and removal of icky DWP nonsense
- buttons to post a log to show you have logged in
- enter activities directly into the script to have them appear in the select drop down
- user friendly 'today' and 'yesterday' instead of dates in activity log


Upcoming Features:

- Email job logs using Gmail API


I've got some other scripts if any one is interest, latest is the one to filter the results table

Perhaps the most or least problem with UJM is no option for negative keywords. My JCP coach wants me to apply for the occasional job from UJM directly but I find it nearly impossible due to all the spam. A new agency has started up in this area specialising in 0Hr contracts list 30+ jobs a day. This may not be pretty but hey it works.


Me:
is there a way to enter negative keywords ? seems like a fairly basic omission if not

UJM twitter support:
Hi Simon, I sought advice from our service provider who provided the following response: “It is not possible for a user to enter search terms that they do not want to be matched against as the site will look at each item entered when a jobseeker searches.” I hope this helps.
